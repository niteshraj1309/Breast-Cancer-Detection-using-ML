Detecting malignant and benign breast cancer cells using machine learning algorithms for early diagnosis and improved treatment outcomes.

Overview : 
Breast cancer is one of the most common and life-threatening diseases among women globally. This project leverages machine learning techniques to classify tumors as benign or malignant based on cell features from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.

🔍 Problem Statement
Early and accurate detection of breast cancer can significantly improve patient survival rates. This project builds predictive models that can help medical professionals make informed decisions.
